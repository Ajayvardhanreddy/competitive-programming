# H-Index II

'''
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

        for idx, c in enumerate(citations):
            current += max(min(c - current, l - idx - current), 0)
            # alternative to above line
            # while (current + 1) <= l - idx and current + 1 <= c:
